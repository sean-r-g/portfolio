## Approach
The approach I took for this project was to outline the overall structure and layout of the website, then the layout of each individual page, and finally the content for each page. To do this, I created a wireframe for the home page, which I then used as the basis for subsequent pages. For styling, I researched popular, professional portfolio website examples to get a sense of common layouts, color schemes, fonts, etc. Specifically for the color scheme, I referenced Adobe's user-submitted color scheme examples and selected my favorite of the bunch. 

After I completed my research and outlines, I started to tackle the actual website build. First, I completed the base HTML code for each page, ensuring the general layout of each page is consistent. Next, I began styling and formatting each page. Again, ensuring the general theme and feel of each page is consistent across the website to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable user experience. Finally, I added in the JavaScript and jQuery code to create user interaction points across the website.
