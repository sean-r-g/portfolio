          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Welcome! I'm Sean Gillis, an asipring software engineer with over five years experience working in the tech industry. I've spent the past several years leading teams of developers, data engineers, and analysts as a project manager -- and now I want be a part of those very teams.</p>
          <p>I've been playing with and working on computers since before grade school, and have carried that passion with me into my professional career. Now, I'm working to make this lifelong passion a focal point of my career.</p>
          <p>Since graduating from Boston College in 2016, I've hopped from one tech hub to another, starting with the city of Boston itself. From there, I moved to Madison, Wisconsin to experience their burgeoning tech scene while working for a leading healthcare software company. Recently, I relocated to one of the hottest cities in the tech industry -- Austin, Texas -- where I will look to further my career as a software engineer.</p>

          <h3>Passions</h3>
          <p>Two of my greatest passions, both personally and professionally, are education and community service. Regardless of my current position or organization, I am constantly looking to integrate these concepts into my daily work and life. It's essential for me to be making a positive impact on my community, be it directly or indirectly.</p>
          <p>I believe it is crucial to view things with a global perspective whenever possible. Growing up in the multi-cultural mecca of Singapore, I learned early and often that one often hinders themself by approaching challenges with a myopic view of the world.</p>
